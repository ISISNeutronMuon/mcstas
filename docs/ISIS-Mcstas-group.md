Welcome to the ISIS Mcstas group. These pages have been created to make it easier to do McStas simulations of ISIS instruments. These pages contain example ISIS instrument files plus all the latest moderator files and components you need to get started, as well as who to contact if you get stuck. Please note, these pages are not intended to teach Mcstas. Please go to the official [Mcstas website](http://mcstas.org/) for more information on downloading and using Mcstas. 

If you have any comments on how to improve these pages then contact Rob Bewley.
