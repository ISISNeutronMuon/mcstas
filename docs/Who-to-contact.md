Who to contact
==============

We all get stuck sometimes when doing Mcstas simulations or perhaps just want someone to check what you have done. There are some people at ISIS who are fairly experienced and would be happy to lend a hand such as myself (Rob Bewley) or Rob Dalgliesh. If we cannot help you then the Mcstas team are great and respond very quickly.
